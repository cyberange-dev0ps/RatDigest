ATTENDEES
David Pinney, Tim Heidel

DATE
22 September 2017

NOTES
- Money? 7.5 M from DARPA RADICS and 3 M REACT
- Timeline? 2016-2019
- Cost Share NRECA put up? NRECA puts in about 4 million in cost share.
- Partners? BlackByte, CMU, NRECA, In2lytics, Cigital

QUESTIONS
- How are you feeling? Staffing and management of GridState is a disaster. PNNL is throwing NRECA under the bus.
- Next year plan? Reducing Phil Craig, halving CMU, removing Cigital, replacing with internal staff that can be trusted.
- Have you called up the people responsible and screamed at them? Yes. Might be an opportunity to be harsher.
- Who all is on the team? Eric Collins In2Lytics, George Half CMU, Phil Craig BlackByte, Bob Wintenburg Cigital. Appears nobody on the GridState can get this done.
- Who's at PNNL that we can lean on? Don't want to talk with them. Promised and failed to deliver Simba. Thomas Edgar (comms sim), Mark Rice.
- Resource for now is David Pinney.
- Where is the GridLAB-D file and does it work at all? In the repo now.

LATER QUESTIONS
- Can someone take my meeting planning tasks off my hands?
- Upwork?

TASKS
XXX Pinney - sending invite for 5:15.
XXX Pinney - check model today.
XXX Pinney - see if I can get cosim working. Reading works fine, writing needs some work.

INPUTS?
- Switch status, load amounts (pre-recorded attacks), LTC taps later (operator error).
- How long does the GLD sim run is it 1 month at second resolution? Yes, this is Tim's ideal.
- GLD attacks: remove meter from system, change load behind meter to zero, spoofed meter (GLD output doesn't change, values in output file do change), switch changes.

COSIM OUTPUTS?
- Timestamped readings for all AMI meters, 2 substation transformers (on PDF) total real and reactive power per phase, 23 switches per phase open/closed binary.
- Must have voltages for all of these.
- Ceiling is 1 Gig [((3 million / 4) * 1 kB) in megabytes]

SECOND CONVO
- We can safely configure the input to GridLAB-D, then manipulate the output. We don't need to cosimulate.
- Tim is building input, output, attack scenarios by Monday morning.
- David will then pick them up and figure out how to implement them.
